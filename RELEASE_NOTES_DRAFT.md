## Highlights

### loop-audit 1.6.0 — governance scoring ([#233](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/233))

Readiness scoring now checks multi-agent safety signals:

- Least-privilege tool scope (`allowed-tools` in skills, scoped MCP)
- Stall / no-progress detection (`loop-context`, circuit breaker, max attempts)
- Human-escalation path (HITL, handoff language in `LOOP.md` / constraints)

Tagged `loop-audit-v1.6.0`.

```bash
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-audit . --suggest
```

### New on npm: `@cobusgreyling/loop-worktree` ([#190](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/190), [#204](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/204))

Isolated git worktrees per fix attempt — supports PR Babysitter and CI Sweeper L2 patterns without branch collisions. Tagged `loop-worktree-v1.0.0`.

```bash
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-worktree create --run-id fix-1 --pattern pr-babysitter
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-worktree list
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-worktree cleanup --older-than 24h
```

### Philosophy & contributor growth

- KY cut surface philosophy v0.1 ([#179](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/179)) — thanks [@sololys](https://github.com/sololys)
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` automation refresh ([#180](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/180))
- Star-history page redesign ([#205](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/205))

### Housekeeping

- **Star-history workflow** — opens an auto-merge PR instead of pushing to protected `main`
- **loop-audit publish** — install `sigstore` before npm publish ([#236](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/pull/236))
- Dependabot bumps: `actions/github-script` 7→9, `@types/node` in loop-audit/loop-init
- Stale branch prune + contributor PR backlog triage
